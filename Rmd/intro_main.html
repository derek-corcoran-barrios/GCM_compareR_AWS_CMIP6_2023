<h4>GCM compareR</h4>
<p>GCM compareR is a web application developed to assist ecologists,
conservationists and policy makers at understanding climate change
scenarios and differences between General Circulation Models (GCMs), and
at assisting the triage of subsets of models in an objective and
informed manner. GCM compareR is written in R and uses the web app
development package Shiny. The code of this app can be find in the
project’s github,
<a href="https://github.com/marquetlab/GCM_compareR" target="_blank">https://github.com/marquetlab/GCM_compareR</a>.</p>
<p>General Circulation Models (GCMs) are key to climate change research.
Currently, scientists can chose from a large number of GCMs, as
meteorological research centers worldwide have contributed more than 35
different GCMs for four distinct climate change scenarios as part of the
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5; <span class="citation">(Taylor, Stouffer, and Meehl 2012)</span>). Projections
of future climate from all these models tell a common story, but the
spread among them is also significant <span class="citation">(Zappa and
Shepherd 2017)</span>, which is an indicator of the irreducible
uncertainty concerning any unverifiable future projection. For this
reason, studies have shown that the choice of GCMs in modeling studies
is an important source of variability in model outputs <span class="citation">(Thuiller et al. 2019)</span>. The situation demands
for workflows to help researchers exploring climate change scenarios to
increase objectivity and repeatability in research and assure a well
judged treatment of uncertainty <span class="citation">(Shepherd et al.
2018)</span>.</p>
<p>GCM compareR has been developed to play this role in helping
researchers approaching GCMs in climate change studies and assist the
selection of climate models. The app offers quick access to preloaded
CMIP5 downscaled GCMs for the four RCPs <span class="citation">(Vuuren
et al. 2011)</span> and allows users to compare their projections for
future years. Comparison results are provided as scatterplots and maps
where users may learn what makes different any GCM, identify groups of
GCMs with similar characteristics (e.g. “colder” or “warmer” in their
projection of temperature increase) and define storylines about the
future climate <span class="citation">(Zappa and Shepherd
2017)</span>.</p>

<div id="use-of-the-app" class="section level4">
<h4>Use of the App</h4>
<p>GCM compareR contains tabs that might be used from left to right to
define a comparison scenario, retrieve results and generate a report
with them.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Intro</em> tab includes all the information needed to use
the app. Move to the <em>Workflow</em> section to find full details
about how to use the app, and go to <em>About</em> to find information
about developers.<br />
</li>
<li>In the <em>Scenario</em> tab you will be able to set up a comparison
scenario by making all choices: select the GCMs you would like to
compare, pick a climate change scenario (year of projection, RCP…) and
set the geographic extent of your analysis. Use the <em>Analyse</em>
button on this tab to trigger the start of the analyses.<br />
</li>
<li>The tabs <em>Explore selected GCMs</em>, <em>Variation from
present</em> and <em>Variation among futures</em> will display the
results after the calculation is completed. Finally, <em>Report</em>
will download a report with all the figures produced and some
explanatory text.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Citation</h4>
<p>Please, if you use GCM compareR as part of your research, cite the

<div id="use-offline" class="section level4">
<h4>Use offline</h4>
<p>You need to be connected online to use the app. When an analysis is
run in the app, many climatic layers in raster format are loaded and
analysed in the background, and these layers encompass several Gb of
hard drive space. However, if you prefer to use the app offline, you may
download it (including climatic layers) from here: (~4.3 Gb)</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/GCM_compareR_offline" class="uri">http://bit.ly/GCM_compareR_offline</a> (copy and paste the
link in your browser)</p>
<p>To run the app locally you need to have
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R</a> and
<a href="https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/" target="_blank">RStudio
Desktop</a> installed. After unzipping the files, locate and open the
<em>GCM_compareR.Rproj</em> file. RStudio will open. While any of the
<em>ui.R</em> or the <em>server.R</em> files are opened, you should see
a <em>run</em> button on the top right corner of the script quadrant.
Clic <em>run</em> to start the app on your default browser.
Alternatively, you can run the code <code>shiny::runApp</code> instead
of pressing <em>run</em>.</p>
