#### Interpretation of maps

The maps on the right represent the bioclimatic variables for the GCMs you have selected to compare. In addition, the first plot is the *baseline* (current version of the bioclimatic variable, from WorldClim v1.4).

All maps are ploted using the same scale, so differences and patterns in them can be identified.
